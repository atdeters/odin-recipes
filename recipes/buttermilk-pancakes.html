	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Flour:</b>
			All-purpose flour contains gluten, which gives the buttermilk 
			pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Sugar:</b>
			Just three tablespoons ofwhite sugar should be enough to lend 
			subtle sweetness. Remember, you'll be adding a lot more sugar
			if you top the pancakes with syrup or molasses!
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Leavener:</b>
			Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners
			(a substance that releases gas when mixed with other ingredients,
			causing the batter to rise to fluffy perfection).
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Salt:</b>
			You definitely don't want to skip adding a small amount of salt
			â€” the buttermilk pancakes will taste bland without it.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Buttermilk:</b>
			Of course, you'll need buttermilk for buttermilk pancakes!
			This recipe calls for three whole cups.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Milk:</b>
			Wholemilk helps create the perfect batter consistency and
			cuts some of the buttermilk's acidity.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Eggs:</b>
			Three whole eggs add structure and rich flavor to the
			buttermilk pancakes.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Butter:</b>
			Melted butter lends flavor and keeps the pancakes
			nice and moist.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Mix the dry Ingredients:</b>
			Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda,
			and salt in a large bowl.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Mix the wet Ingredients:</b>
			Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together
			in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients
			until right before you cook the pancakes.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Make the pancakes:</b>
			Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a
			wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended.
			Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the
			pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook
			until both sides are brown.
		</li>
	</ol>
